He won the treble (Serie A, Coppa Italia and Champions League) in 2010. Balotelli reunited with Inter manager Roberto Mancini at Manchester City in 2010, helping them win a Premier League title and FA Cup. He moved back to Italy in January 2013, signing for AC Milan, before returning to the Premier League with Liverpool 18 months later. Following a return to Milan on loan, Balotelli departed to France, playing for Nice and Marseille in Ligue 1. He returned to Italy a third time, joining Serie A club Brescia in summer 2019, and Serie B club Monza in late 2020. The following summer, Balotelli signed for Turkish club Adana Demirspor.\r\n\r\nBalotelli earned his first cap for Italy in a friendly match against the Ivory Coast in 2010. He amassed over 30 caps and represented his country at UEFA Euro 2012, the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He helped the national side reach the final of Euro 2012, scoring twice against Germany in the semi-final, and won bronze at the Confederations Cup. Balotelli is Italy's joint-top-scorer in the UEFA European Championship, and joint-top-scorer in the FIFA Confederations Cup.\r\n\r\nRegarded as a highly promising player in his youth, Balotelli is a versatile forward with strength, pace and an eye for goal. He is regarded as one of the best penalty kick takers in world football. Despite his talent, Balotelli has been criticised for his poor attitude on and off the pitch.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strSide":"","strPosition":"Forward","strCollege":null,"strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/MarioOfficialBalotelli","strWebsite":"","strTwitter":"twitter.com\/finallymario","strInstagram":"instagram.com\/mb459","strYoutube":"","strHeight":"189 cm","strWeight":"86 kg","intLoved":"0","strThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/player\/thumb\/qqvuvq1431622719.jpg","strCutout":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/player\/cutout\/alfgb41610666098.png","strRender":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/player\/render\/sz8mu61654253818.png","strBanner":null,"strFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/player\/fanart\/wwtsqs1431622222.jpg","strFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/player\/fanart\/upxsxy1431622235.jpg","strFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/player\/fanart\/vxqsyv1431622253.jpg","strFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/player\/fanart\/tvxuyq1431622269.jpg","strCreativeCommons":"No","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
