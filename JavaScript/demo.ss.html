    <p>Information flow in organization

        Within the organization, information may flow downward to the sub-ordinates, upwards to superiors, horizontal to the peers, cross-channel to the people in different departments in the organization. These four types of communication make up the organization's formal communication network. (Omar Ali, p. 94)
        
        Information flows in an organization both formally and informally. The term formal communication refers to communication that follows the official hierarchy and is required to do one's job. In other words, it flows through formal channels-the main lines of organizational communication. Internal-operational and external-operational communication can be describes as formal.
        
        In fact, the bulk of communication that a business needs in order to operate flows through these channels. For example, when a manager instructs a subordinate on some matter or when an employee brings a problem to a supervisor's attention, the act of communication is formal. Similarly, when two employees interact to discuss a customer's order, there is a formal communication. Information of various kinds flowing through formal channels, such as policy or procedural changes, orders, instructions, confidential reports, etc., is classified as formal communication. This type of communication can flow in various directions- downward, upward, lateral or diagonal. (Raman and Sharma, p. 12-13). See also Bhatia, p. 51-54.</p>
